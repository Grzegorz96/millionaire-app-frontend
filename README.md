# MILLIONAIRE.app

Millionaire.app is my original project, a clone of the popular millionaires game show. The program allows users to join the community and compete with each other, thanks to the system of points received after the end of the game. All operations using data in this application are performed through the API and database at pythonanywhere hosting.
